<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--Add Screenshot here -->

BandDB is designed to be a simple, user-friendly database management system for secondary and post-secondary band directors. If you have used Charms in the past and struggled with it, then you need to check out BandDB! 

Features of BandDB:
* Keep a digital Instrument Inventory and track which instruments are checked out to which students 
* Digitize your music library!
* Assign Lockers to students and easily access their locker combination when they forget! 

### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/)
* [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Students Tab
In the Students Tab you can see all of your students. On each student you can assign them a locker, and also easily access their locker combination if they forget it! You can also add new students using the form at the top of the page, or delete a student that is no longer attending your school.

### Lockers Tab
In the Lockers Tab you see a full list of all the lockers in your room, and any students that are assigned to them. This can be another way to easily access locker information for a student.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

I plan on refactoring this entire project in the future to implement a Ruby on Rails backend as opposed to a Sinatra backend. I also want to add user authentication for teachers to login and only see their students.
